# Tech Accessories Store

A website for a fictional store that can be used by both store owners and consumers. The front-end layout and interactivity are scripted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and this is incorporated with the back-end, which handles user input processing and authentication using PHP. Finally, MySQL is used to maintain a database used for reading, creating, and deleting products.

Made in Spring 2024 for NJIT's IT202 class.
